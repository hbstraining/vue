## Details

In this course, you'll be introduced to what Vue.js can do, without digging deeply into what makes it work.  In writing your first Vue.js shopping list application, you'll be exposed to the following concepts:

1. two-way data binding
1. template syntax and expressions
1. Vue directives, loops and conditional rendering
1. Vue Devtools
1. handling user Inputs
1. handling Events
1. Vue.js Methods and Computed Properties
1. attribute Bindings and dynamic classes
